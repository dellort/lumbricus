Our programming style... just to make the code look less chaotic.

One indentation is 4 spaces long. Don't use tabs. There's a hard limit of 80
columns per physical line.

Generally like Java. Method names start with a lowercase letter, and the rest is
in camelcase. Private member variables start with the small letter m. Public
member variables are treated like properties, and as such, the method naming
rules apply to them.

Maybe I forgot something important... anyway, it's 5:30 AM.

Here's a larger example:


module something.filename;

public class FooBla {
    private uint mMemberVar;
    
    private void methodSomething() {
    }
    
    /// doc string for public members!
    //the 80 column limit must be respected!
    //if the line is too long, the next line is indented by one indentation
    public void methodToolongToFitInOneDamnLineSoItMustBreak(uint foo,
        uint blabla)
    {
        if (condition) {
            something();
        }
        int[] intarr;
        foreach (uint anything; intarr) {
            if (anything == 0) {
                //uh
            } else {
                //oh
            }
            switch (anything) {
                case 1: {
                    something();
                    break;
                }
                default:
                    somethingDifferent();
            }
            try {
                //a
            } finally {
                //b
            }
        }
    }
}
