This is Lumbricus Terrestris. There's also a little info on our project page:
    https://gna.org/projects/lumbricus

Status:

    Sorry, it's at a very early alpha/beta state, it is not really ready yet.

    Working:
    - it's playable
    - can use original WWP graphics using a converter

    Missing:
    - free graphics (there are only "stub" graphics)
    - and free sounds
    - nicer and more complete user interface
    - network mode that actually works (or just forget about it)
    - simple way to compile/install

    The code is written in the D Programming Language version 1.x, see:
    http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/
    Because of this the code is very hard to compile.

Version status for tools and libraries:
    D compiler:
        You need one of those...
        dmd: 1.057 and following should work
        ldc: newest version may work, though there are often regressions
        gdc: forget it (maybe one day...)
    Tango (alternative D standard library):
        svn r5396: works
        release 0.99.9: works
    Derelict (D bindings for various C libs):
        http://svn.dsource.org/projects/derelict/trunk/
        svn r481: works
            for DerelictUtil, DerelictFT, DerelictGL, DerelictGLU, DerelictSDL, DerelictSDLImage, DerelictAL

Building it:

    This is can be very hard (depending how much D experience you have).
    Your options:
    - Forget it, give up.
    - Ask us on the lonely plains in irc.freenode.net #lumbricus
    - Send us spam by e-mail. (Addresses are somewhere on
      https://gna.org/projects/lumbricus/)
    - Try building the debian package (execute dpkg-buildpackage in the trunk/
      directory) - may be randomly broken, though.

Required libraries:
- Dynamic linked (.dll/.so):
  - SDL
  - SDL_image
  - Freetype
  - Zlib
  - Lua 5.1

  - ENet (enet.bespin.org) (optional)
  - FMod (optional)
  - OpenAL (optional)
  For Win32, all required .dll files can be found in <svn_root>/downloads/win32_dlls
- Static linked D libraries:
  - Derelict for the 2 SDL libraries
  - Tango (comes not with DMD)

Using the WWP data converter:
  extractdata expects the Worms(TM) directory and an output
  dir as arguments, and converts the file to images/conf-files Lumbricus can
  understand. Call it like this:

   extractdata pathtowwp

  Note that this needs some additional data files from
    trunk/share/lumbricus/wimport
  The files are searched in <path_to_extractdata_binary>/../share/lumbricus/wimport,
  so if you leave your executable in the default output path you should be fine.

  The WWP datafiles just contain lists of compressed images/animations, which
  are obviously (?) only addressed by their index-number. So we had to create
  our own description file, which maps the animation index to a name. This is
  trunk/bin/tools/animations.txt. If your WWP datafiles are somehow different,
  the animation numbers in animations.txt may need to be changed.

  To inspect the WWP datafiles, you can unpack them with unworms (using
  extractdata is impractical, because it only converts the animations in
  animations.txt). Compile unworms with "dsss build ../bin/tools/unworms". You
  can call it on .dir, .bnk, .img and .spr files.
