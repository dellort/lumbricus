This is Lumbricus Terrestris. Sorry, it's at a very early planning state,
there's nothing to see or to play yet.

WARNING: Yeah sure, you can compile the code, but to run it, the svn misses
some important bits. Running the program right out of the SVN will crash,
complaining about strange missing things or files.

At some time we'll make sure it works just with the data from this SVN.

If you wonder in what language the already existing code is written in:
It's Digital Mars D. A nice native compiled, garbage collected C descendant,
which is modern and wants to be not as f***ed up as C++. There are compilers
for Windows and Linux. D is still in "development", every new release of the
Digital Mars D Compiler (DMD) can break any existing D code. (Well, every new
release of G++ breaks my C++ code too :-) ...oh and that's because of C++, not
my C++ skills, lol.)

Building it...

A D compiler for D 1.0 is required.
I.e.: http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/dcompiler.html

Required libraries:
- Dynamic linked (.dll/.so):
  - SDL
  - SDL_image
  - SDL_ttf
- Static linked D libraries:
  - Derelict for the 3 SDL libraries (http://dsource.org/projects/derelict)
  - Phobos (comes with DMD)

Windows:
You can use Code::Blocks, but better compile using rebuild; see below.

Linux:
(Code::Blocks should work too, untested)

1. Get Derelict, and put the files into an include path found by DMD, i.e.
   you can put the files into dmd/src/phobos/derelict/sdl/ or so.
2. Get rebuild (http://svn.dsource.org/projects/dsss/downloads/rebuild/) and
   invoke it like:
   $ rebuild -lldl -oqbin lumbricus.d
   You also can use dsss and invoke it doing "dsss build" (dsss uses rebuild).
