This is Lumbricus Terrestris. Sorry, it's at a very early planning state,
there's nothing to see or to play yet.

If you wonder in what language the already existing code is written in:
It's Digital Mars D. A nice native compiled, garbage collected C descendant,
which is modern and wants to be not as f***ed up as C++. There are compilers
for Windows and Linux. D is still in "development", every new release of the
Digital Mars D Compiler (DMD) can break any existing D code. (Well, every new
release of G++ breaks my C++ code too :-)
