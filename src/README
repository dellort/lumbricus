This is Lumbricus Terrestris. Sorry, it's at a very early planning state,
there's nothing to see or to play yet.

If you wonder in what language the already existing code is written in:
It's Digital Mars D. A nice native compiled, garbage collected C descendant,
which is modern and wants to be not as f***ed up as C++. There are compilers
for Windows and Linux. D is still in "development", every new release of the
Digital Mars D Compiler (DMD) can break any existing D code. (Well, every new
release of G++ breaks my C++ code too :-)

More Information can be found at:

Building it...

A D compiler for D 1.0 is required.
xxx list required libraries here

Windows:
Use Code::Blocks.

Linux:
(Code::Blocks should work too, untested)

1. Get Derelict, and put the files into an include path found by DMD, i.e.
   you can put the files into src/phobos/derelict/sdl/ or so.
2. Get rebuild (http://svn.dsource.org/projects/dsss/downloads/rebuild/) and
   invoke it like:
   $ rebuild -lldl -oqbin maingame.d
   You also can use dsss and invoke it doing "dsss build".
