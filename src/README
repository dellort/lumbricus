This is Lumbricus Terrestris. Sorry, it's at a very early alpha/beta state,
it is not really ready yet.

WARNING: Currently needs original worms files to run at all. Probably it only
works with the version of WWP which was available to us. You need to compile and
run the program "extractdata" and place the resulting files into the data/data2
directory.

At some time we'll make sure it works just with the data from this SVN.

The code is in the D Programming Language, see:
http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/

There's also a little info on our project page:
https://gna.org/projects/lumbricus

Building it...

A D compiler for D 1.0 is required.
I.e.: http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/dcompiler.html

Should work under x86 Windows and Linux.
GDC supports more arches, but at least for amd64 it is slightly broken and won't
work with this code (format()-ing struct arguments isn't implemented).

Required libraries:
- Dynamic linked (.dll/.so):
  - SDL
  - SDL_image
  - SDL_ttf
- Static linked D libraries:
  - Derelict for the 3 SDL libraries (http://dsource.org/projects/derelict)
  - Phobos (comes with DMD)

1. Get Derelict, and put the files into an include path found by DMD, i.e.
   you can put the files into dmd/src/phobos/derelict/sdl/ or so.
2. Get dsss (http://svn.dsource.org/projects/dsss/downloads/) and compile the
   stuff, I'm not sure how, lol. But usually:
   $ dsss build TARGET
   Where TARGET is ../bin/lumbricus and ../bin/extractdata
   (extractdata is the WWP data converter).
