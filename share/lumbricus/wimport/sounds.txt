        Probably each node (for each language) should generate an additional
            .conf file, which is then stored under locale-specific mount points?

        Or simpler: put all .conf files into the same directory, and name them
            e.g. sounds_en.conf (sounds_<languagecode>.conf), and add special
            code load the right file.

        Another problem is, that not all languages might be available. E.g. a
            French WWP probably contains French sounds, but not German ones.

    sounds_de {
        //include all the sounds from node "normal", which weren't defined here
        //yet (this means you can do language specific overrides for "normal")
        include = "normal"
        path = "User/Speech/German"
        files {
            byebye = "BYEBYE.WAV"
        }
    }
    sounds_en {
        include = "normal"
        path = "User/Speech/English"
        files {
            byebye = "BYEBYE.WAV"
        }
    }
    */
}
